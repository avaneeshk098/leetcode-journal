| Problem Name | Difficulty | Approach | Problem Link |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Medium  | Move the left pointer of the sliding window when the frequency of any character is more than 1 else keep moving the right pointer. | [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/] |
| Trapping Rain Water | Hard  | The amount of water stored at a particular height is determined by the minimum of the maximum height on the left or the right of a given point on the map.  | [https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/] |
| Subarray Sums Divisible by k | Medium | The observation to notice for the subarray sums to be divisible the prefix sum at the start and the end of the subarray mod k must be equal. | [https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k] | 
| Sliding Window Maximum | Hard | Using the monotonic queue technique to maintain the maximum when the sliding window moves. | [https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum] |
| Longest Repeating Character Replacement| Medium | Use a sliding window and a hashmap to keep track of the character with maximum frequency. If the total characters in the window except the most frequent one is less than k then return True else False. | [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement]
